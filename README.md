## üöÄ Project Overview

ResumeReviewer helps job seekers transform vague bullet points into targeted, metric-driven statements that align with a specific job description.

- **Parse** PDF resumes into structured sections and bullets via a parsing LLM.
- **Detect issues** in each bullet (missing action verbs, metrics, or key skills) using an LLM and heuristic fallbacks.
- **Retrieve examples** from a curated corpus with FAISS-powered RAG for semantic similarity.
- **Rewrite bullets** with an LLM guided by retrieved examples and job requirements.
- **Serve** results in a Streamlit front end, backed by FastAPI.
